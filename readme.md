# CLI_chess

## Description

Python Chess game, developed using TDD. The main objective
of the project is to showcase how TDD enables a clean architecture
and development process.

## Development process

The project was developed using TDD. The tests are located in the
`tests` folder. The goal is to have a test for each feature in the game.
The only external library used is `pytest` for testing.

## How to play

The game is played in the terminal. Each player will be prompted to
pass a move using the official chess notation. The game will validate the
move and update the board accordingly. The game will end when a player is
in checkmate or stalemate. At least the most basic rules of draw are
implemented.

## How to run

To run the game, simply run the `main.py` file.
